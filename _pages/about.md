PA JHipster is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.tech) generator that enables you scaffold [process awareness web application](/process-awareness-web-app). The current version of the generator is based on AngularJS, Spring Boot and Camunda. To learn more about the architecture of the application generated by the PA JHipster, I recommend read [Web App Architecture](/docs/web-app-architecture/).


The PA JHipster is part of a research initiative conducted by the [Untacit Team](http://untacit.com) that aims at exploring various aspects related to Knowledge Intensive Process (KIP). To learn more about KIP I strongly recommend the visiting the Untacit KIP Website.

The better way to use and learn more the PA JHipster is to follow the [Quick-Start Guide](/docs/quick-start-guide/).

Hope you enjoy it.
